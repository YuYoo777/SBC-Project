### First job

[The work of "Loving Look"](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/86143322425923005940680517055148775215163601153926590747261820762697882402818)
is a vision of a strong Ukrainian soul and patriotism. The story of the postcard tells about the events of wartime, when rockets fly into residential areas and people are forced to see the horror of the war right from the windows of their houses, but at the same time they do not leave their homes in the hope that this will all stop soon. People cannot simply leave their homes, as this is a part of their soul and life lived. The main character of the picture is a guy who watches what is happening around and no matter what horrors appear - this young girl at the window is the only thing he has, a ray of hope for an early victory.
  Eyes falling from heaven symbolize shells flying from Russia, the guy watching the girl is a parallel with the Ukrainian defenders who protect us as a single value - the people, and look after every civilian, protecting even at the cost of their own lives. The NFT is solding for 5 WETH (The work is presented as one of a kind)

The courage and thirst for victory of the Ukrainian people impressed him, but he intends to stop the bloodshed on the territory of Ukraine and throughout the world.
