### First job

[The work of "Loving Look"](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/86143322425923005940680517055148775215163601153926590747261820762697882402818)
is a vision of a strong Ukrainian soul and patriotism. The story of the postcard tells about the events of wartime, when rockets fly into residential areas and people are forced to see the horror of the war right from the windows of their houses, but at the same time they do not leave their homes in the hope that this will all stop soon. People cannot simply leave their homes, as this is a part of their soul and life lived. The main character of the picture is a guy who watches what is happening around and no matter what horrors appear - this young girl at the window is the only thing he has, a ray of hope for an early victory.
  Eyes falling from heaven symbolize shells flying from Russia, the guy watching the girl is a parallel with the Ukrainian defenders who protect us as a single value - the people, and look after every civilian, protecting even at the cost of their own lives. The NFT is solding for 5 WETH (The work is presented as one of a kind)

calls to stop the war on the territory of Ukraine by the invaders! This creature takes its roots from the spiral galaxy NGC 4945.

This code was given to him before birth and is a set of genetic key in his World. He arrived in the form of a hologram on earth to rally earthlings, since in the future they could be overtaken by Godnerians - creatures that capture planets and even galaxies. The Ambassador visited every corner of the earth to see a large-scale picture of the tragedy of all mankind. The courage and thirst for victory of the Ukrainian people impressed him, but he intends to stop the bloodshed on the territory of Ukraine and throughout the world. 
Around the head of this character are four small rotating planets. In the center of his forehead, he has a kind of hole inside which a rotating sphere is represented as a thinking organ (brain); This sphere changes its color scheme depending on the mood of the Real Peacemaker. Below is a yellowish linguistic device in the form of a collar so he can negotiate with natives in different parts of the universe. The character also has armor that is presented as a cloaked shoulder pad it is green; on the left the symbol of the pedigree; on the right side the circle with a dot in the center is the so-called “living barrier” that, when pressed, can protect the main character. We must not forget about the physiological components such as three nostrils and the absence of ears. The NFT is offered as one of a kind and is solding for 2 WETH.

## Step 2

The second stage of development is the creation of new NFTs in the amount of 3.425 copies. All those who have purchased our works will be able to participate in subsequent projects and universes. Profits from sales will be allocated to the "Come Back Alive" fund and to all residents of the country who have suffered damage or need financial support. We are also proud and believe that some funds should be directed to our Ukrainian Armed Forces who, day and night, at the cost of their own lives protect the rights, interests of the population and the territory of the Ukrainian state.

## Step 3

We are working on the development of a blockchain game that will be presented in the future. This version of the game will be presented based on historical events that will be of interest to all age groups. The game will be presented in the form of quests and puzzles that will expand knowledge about the history of Ukraine and the whole world and also provide a platform for expanding horizons and mental abilities. In view of the gaming process of learning, the historical-progressive idea becomes fascinating and unique. Every person in the 21st century should know their history.
We will connect the best historians of the world to put together the puzzle of world history, since all people and states have some kind of thin thread - all people are interconnected. With ignorance and not studying one state or nation we get the wrong picture of the worldview.
It's great to travel the world and plunge into different eras and centuries with just a phone and our games in hand. Just by playing and exploring the world there will be an opportunity to earn and exchange in-game tokens.
    In addition to the development of a blockchain game, we are going to create a marketplace platform where our and other works of comics artists from different parts of the world will be presented. This is a great idea for raising this type of art intertwined with literature to a new level of development and reader interest. We guarantee fascinating stories that will captivate their connoisseurs - new interesting characters and presentation in a new digital format of book and magazine illustrations.
We cannot miss the opportunity to help Ukraine – every 1.5% sold from NFT comics will be donated to Ukrainian funds.
